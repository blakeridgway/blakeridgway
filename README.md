I’ve spent most of my career as a Systems Administrator, working with Linux, AWS, Azure, and automating servers. I’m also well-versed in Cisco, Fortigate, and Netgate network solutions. Over the years, I’ve focused on making infrastructure more efficient, secure, and scalable. Now, I’m diving into the world of cybersecurity, expanding my skills to better protect systems, networks, and data.

My goal is to apply my systems administration experience to the field of cybersecurity, finding innovative ways to keep systems running smoothly while strengthening security. I’m passionate about driving continuous improvement, constantly seeking new solutions to optimize performance and safeguard critical infrastructure. I’m dedicated to not just managing IT systems but refining and fine-tuning them, ensuring peak performance and security across the board. I strive to distinguish myself as a specialist who goes beyond basic IT management, implementing state-of-the-art solutions that enhance both efficiency and safety.

When I’m not geeking out over tech, you’ll probably find me out on my bike. Cycling is more than a hobby for me—it’s a way to clear my head, get inspired, and stay grounded. It was during one of these rides that I came up with the idea for an open-source platform to help cyclists train smarter. By combining the best features of tools like TrainingPeaks, Intervals.icu, and TrainerRoad, I’m building something that will give other riders the data they need to improve their performance, all while keeping their information secure.
