In the Agribusiness realm, I'm not just another Systems Administrator—I'm the one who's all about fine-tuning operations and making things run smoothly with IT solutions. My heart beats for Linux, and my belief in open source principles guides every move I make.

But there's more to me than just work. Outside of the office, you'll often find me on two wheels, cycling through the countryside or tackling challenging trails. Cycling isn't just a hobby for me—it's my sanctuary, offering balance and clarity that directly contribute to my professional effectiveness.

In fact, it was during one of those rides that the idea for my passion project struck: creating an open-source cycling training site that's like a blend of TrainingPeaks, Intervals.icu, and a dash of TrainerRoad magic. It's my way of merging my love for technology with my passion for cycling, offering riders a comprehensive tool to take their riding to the next level.

And as if that weren't enough, I'm also on a journey of my own—earning my Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity from Southern New Hampshire University. It's not just about advancing my career; it's about embracing a field I'm passionate about and continuously expanding my horizons.

Between optimizing operations, coding up cycling solutions, hitting the books for my degree, and pedaling through the great outdoors, you could say I've got a lot on my plate. But hey, that's just how I roll, both personally and professionally.
